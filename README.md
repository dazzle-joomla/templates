# Joomla! Templates
Joomla! core templates for the Joomla! Content Management System.
# Why are the Joomla! templates seperated from the content management system?
Our project is to create our own cms based on Joomla! as we slowly rewrite every feature of the Joomla core into something better and more secure and easier for the user.
# Why are rewriting Joomla when Joomla is already actively maintained by the Joomla! team.
Our goal for Joomla will mean we have to rewrite all of Joomla! core files and will end up breaking anything that currently works with Joomla!
